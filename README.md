# Dev Helpers WordPress Plugin

This repo is developed from the starter plugin for [KnowTheCode.io](https://knowthecode.io). Check out the [Letâ€™s Build a WordPress Starter Plugin](https://knowthecode.io/labs/lets-build-wordpress-starter-plugin) lab, where you will build this custom plugin with [Tonya](https://knowthecode.io/about) as she explains each step.

## Features

This plugin includes the following features:

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency Manager for PHP
2. [Kint](https://github.com/kint-php/kint) - Awesome package that helps you to debug - forget `var_dump` and `print_r`. You are going to love Kint.
3. [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) - Oh man, you will wonder why this isn't built into PHP. When an error occurs, this displayer replaces out the PHP orange table and gives you information you can actually use.

## Installation

1. Download it.
2. Put into your `wp-content/plugins/` folder
3. Extract it
4. Go into the new folder
5. Run `composer install` in terminal to bring in the dependencies and install Composer locally.

Installation from GitHub is as simple as cloning the repo onto your local machine.  To clone the repo, do the following:
